== Changelog ==

Version 0.4 (2023-02-22)
-------------------------
- Added WordPress 6.1 support.
	- Theme.json: Added spacingSizes.
	- Theme.json: Added element styles for button, heading, caption, and link, and removed the CSS it replaces.
	- Enabled fluid font sizes in theme.json.
	- Enabled useRootPaddingAwareAlignments in theme.json.
	- Enabled blockGap in theme.json.
	- Updated "Requires at least" and "Tested up to" to 6.1.
- Removed some custom styles for the calendar and tables from style.css.
- Bumped copyright year in the footer to 2023.
- Removed function_exists() checks for register_block_pattern_category and register_block_style, since we're requiring WordPress 6.1.

Version 0.3 (2022-10-10)
-------------------------
- Replaced the home.html template with front-page.html, since the blog archive is unusable when home.html is included in the theme. This could cause issues if you don't have a page set as "Homepage" on Settings → Reading.

Version 0.2.6 (2022-10-07)
-------------------------
- Removed index.php, since it's no longer needed to pass the WordPress.org automatic theme review.

Version 0.2.5 (2022-09-27)
-------------------------
- Updated <!-- wp:template-part --/> to omit the "theme":"poe" code, fixing issues when modifying template parts in child themes (thanks, @janboddez).

Version 0.2.4 (2022-09-09)
-------------------------
- Another stab at the blockGap issue, now by removing spaces around the values inside var() which seem to trip up Gutenberg.

Version 0.2.3 (2022-09-09)
-------------------------
- Fixed a blockGap issue causing missing gutters in columns when running the Gutenberg plugin.

Version 0.2.2 (2022-07-28)
-------------------------
- Moved the contents of header.html and footer.html to their respective patterns, and included those patterns with <!-- wp:pattern /--> in the template parts.
- Added a maximum width to inputs, preventing overflow of inputs without plugin styles.

Version 0.2.1 (2022-07-15)
-------------------------
- Updated the demo content pattern to remove the second section with post previews, preventing duplicated content on home.html by default.
- Added placeholder links to all menus, and removed reference to menu ID (ref attribute).

Version 0.2 (2022-07-14)
-------------------------
- Moved all of the patterns to the /patterns/ folder, and removed the PHP functions previously used to register patterns.
- Added home.html, which can be used as a starting point for a home page and is displayed as the front page in the Preview on WordPress.org. It outputs the new demo content pattern.
- New patterns:
	- General: Demo content
	- General: Wide heading with link
	- Portfolio: Portfolio cases

Version 0.1.2 (2022-07-13)
-------------------------
- Updated the screenshot to look less like an ad.
- Updated the theme description with accurate number of Global Styles variations.

Version 0.1.1 (2022-07-12)
-------------------------
- Minor fixes in the style.css theme description.
- Fixed the font filename in theme.json having incorrect casing, causing issues on some hosts.
- Fixed default pull quote font size.
- Adjusted post header block gap.

Version 0.1 (2022-07-11)
