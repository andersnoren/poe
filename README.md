# Poe

Poe is a clean, flexible and fast block theme built with portfolios and blogs in mind. Its default look is a stylish white on black color scheme with yellow accents and clean sans-serif typography, but Poe is built from the ground up for flexibility. It includes ten different theme styles to choose from, and over 30 different block patterns that you can use to quickly create unique page layouts.

## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
